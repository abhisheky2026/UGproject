The Smart Patrobot, stands for “Patrolling Robot”, is an innovative solution designed to 
enhance community safety and promote sustainable gardening. This project integrates two 
critical aspects - patrolling in society for security and monitoring the moisture levels of 
plants for efficient agricultural management. It leverages advanced technology to create a 
multifunctional system that benefits both urban and rural environments. The primary goal 
is to design a versatile robot capable of patrolling public spaces for enhanced security and 
surveillance, while also assisting in gardening tasks to contribute positively to the 
community's aesthetics and green spaces
